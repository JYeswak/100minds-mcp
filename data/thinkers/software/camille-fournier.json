      "description": "As tech lead, balance technical work with project management and team health. You can't do it all yourself. Tech leads spend 30% of time coding, down from 70%. The rest is code review, design, unblocking, and communication. Learn to delegate. Your job is to make the team successful, not to be the hero. Resist the urge to take on the hardest technical work yourself.",
