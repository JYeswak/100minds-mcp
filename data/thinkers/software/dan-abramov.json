Copy-paste twice, then look for patterns. Wrong abstractions are harder to fix than duplication. When you do abstract, make it easy to inline back if the abstraction proves wrong.",

Good components are composable, testable, and reusable. Separate presentational components from logic. Lift state to the lowest common ancestor. Design props as your public API.",
